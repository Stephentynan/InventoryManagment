Last week we all generated 3 AI images for our countertops, grouped them into categories, and pushed them to the git repo. In addition to our normal weekly meeting (which we recorded for Milestone 2), we also held a meeting to talk about website layout. We created a powerpoint and Lucid chart to represent our layout. This week we are working on finalizing the details of each page and moving that information into a markdown file for Milestone 4. We also created this document and added this first post for Milestone 3. There are currently no roadblocks in our way.

Last week we submitted Milestone 3 with our first weekly status report. We also worked on transferring the layout we designed together on PPT over to the official Web_Layout.md for Milestone 4. Each team member was responsible for transferring an assigned page to the MD file and everyone completed their tasks. The document now contains an image of the overall layout as well as page description, links, parameters, and data for each page. This week we are going to finalize the document by adding in test cases and any final visuals. Each team member is assigned the same sections and test cases as last week - trello has been updated accordingly. In our weekly meeting we also started brainstorming next steps we can take to prepare for actually implementing the website (starting html docs, designing schemas, etc.) and plan to formally assign those tasks next week. All group members attended the meeting and participated. There are currently no roadblocks in our way.
